**Important:** This is **not meant for serious work or production** environments under 
*any* circumstance. It is just a toy project with data I use for demos. I reserve the
right to modify and remove the data or take down the whole thing without notice.
I probably won't do that, but if you want something you can rely on, just fork it.
